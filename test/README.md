# Test Directory

This directory contains all Jest tests for the n8n-nodes-imap project.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Writing Tests

Tests should follow these conventions:
- Use `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` suffix for test files
- Place tests in subdirectories that mirror the source structure
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
